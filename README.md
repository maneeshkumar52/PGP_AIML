## 2. Supervised Learning

This Project involved using classification algorithms to predict the income level of the customers based on attributes like 'sex', 'marital-status', 'age', 'occupation' etc. The classification algorithms that were used are: 
  * Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
  * Support Vector Classifier     
 And finally, a comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction.

## 4. Unsupervised Learning

This project invovled using classification of vehicles into different types based on silhouttes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVC for classification and GridSearch was used to find the optimal hyper-parameters for the model. Further, the metrics of models were compared based on 4 different attributes:
  * Support Vector Classifier with PCA
  * Support Vector Classifier with PCA using GridSearch
  * Support Vector Classifier without PCA	
  * Support Vector Classifier without PCA using GridSearch	

#### Skills and Tools :  
Support Vector Classifier, Principal Component Analysis

## 6. Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.    
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. 

#### Skills and Tools :
